# Waterfall

Waterfall is a fork of the well-known [BungeeCord](https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord) server teleportation suite.

Waterfall focuses on three main areas:

* **Stability**: Waterfall aims to be stable. We will achieve this through making the code base testable and discouraging practices that lead to proxy lag.
* **Features**: Waterfall aims to include more features than canonical BungeeCord.
* **Scalability**: Waterfall should be able to handle a large number of concurrent players, given a reasonably modern CPU, memory, and good network connection.

## Why fork BungeeCord?

Think of Waterfall as a principles fork. We feel that Waterfall is a way to ultimately better the BungeeCord ecosystem by providing a faster path for new features.
